## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
activity<-read.csv("activity.csv")
activity_wide<-reshape(activity,timevar="date",idvar=c("interval"),direction="wide")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
hist(activity$steps)
mean(complete.cases(activity$steps))
median(complete.cases(activity$steps))
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
daily_ave<-data.frame(Interval=activity_wide[,1], AverageSteps=rowMeans(activity_wide[,-1],na.rm=TRUE))
plot(daily_ave,type="l")
daily_ave[which.max(daily_ave$AverageSteps),1]
```

## Imputing missing values
```{r}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
